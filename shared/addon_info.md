# Addon info

This addon is split into two parts:
* The actual "sub addon" folder that contains all addon specific code
* A shared folder that contains functions that are used in multiple of my addons

It is designed in such a way that you can add as many different "sub addons" as you want by simply dropping their sub addon folders into the parent directory (one above this, on the same level as the shared folder).
Then all of their preferences will be shown on different pages, and all icons will be loaded automatically.

Currently, these are the addons I have made that are compatible with this:
* Node minimap
* Poly frames (not released)
